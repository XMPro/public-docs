# Upgrade

It is necessary to first uninstall the installers on the host server before proceeding with the upgrade installers. Once you have removed the installers, the procedure for the upgrade is the same as the original install.

This section aims to provide step-by-step instructions on how to safely uninstall only the XMPro installers and not the on-premises deployed XMPro solution.

The process of uninstalling the XMPro installer must be repeated for each application individually. The steps are the same for each application installer and the sequence is not significant.
