<h2>Alternative Approaches</h2>
<p>To tackle these challenges, many companies rely on <strong>point solutions</strong> and <strong>specialist consultants</strong> to build <strong>bespoke systems</strong> tailored to specific operational needs. These custom solutions are often designed to address immediate issues, but they come with inherent limitations.<br/>

<p>One of the primary challenges is the <strong>Theory of Constraints.</strong> As these bespoke solutions are developed, they frequently solve one bottleneck, only to reveal a new one, potentially leading to even worse performance if the new bottleneck is not addressed. For example, in the mining industry, a company might deploy an advanced predictive maintenance tool to monitor the health of conveyor belts. This tool can predict when a conveyor belt is likely to fail, allowing maintenance to be scheduled proactively, thereby reducing unplanned downtime. However, as the predictive maintenance tool optimizes conveyor belt performance and increases their capacity, a new bottleneck is revealed at the hoists. The hoists, which are not integrated with the predictive maintenance system, become the next point of failure as they cannot handle the increased load from the conveyors. This lack of integration results in fragmented data and disjointed processes, making it difficult to achieve a holistic view of operations and causing new inefficiencies to emerge.<br/>

<p>Moreover, as new solutions are required, the problem intensifies. Each new system, whether for process optimization, OEE tracking, or environmental monitoring, is typically built independently and lacks interoperability with existing tools. This creates a <strong>complex web of disconnected systems</strong> that fail to provide cohesive operational insights. Over time, maintaining and scaling these disparate solutions becomes increasingly challenging and expensive.</p>
<p>The complexity of managing these fragmented solutions often results in <strong>skyrocketing costs</strong>. Many man-hours are spent on building and manually integrating bespoke systems, leading to significant financial burdens. The continuous need for customization and manual updates further increases operational costs and resource allocation, diverting attention from strategic initiatives.</p>
<p>The <strong>disconnect between IT and OT systems</strong> further complicates the situation. IT focuses on data processing and cybersecurity, while OT is concerned with physical processes and machinery. This separation can lead to integration challenges, data silos, inconsistent insights, and operational delays, making it difficult to achieve unified, real-time operational visibility.</p>
<p>The current approach to building operational and business process solutions is <strong>fundamentally flawed</strong>. Companies are forced to piece together point solutions and bespoke systems, leading to <strong>inefficiencies and a fragmented view of their operations</strong>. The reliance on manual, rule-based systems further exacerbates these issues, causing operational inefficiencies and limiting insights. This results in a competitive disadvantage as companies struggle to keep up with more modernized competitors.<br/>
