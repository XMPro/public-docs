<h3>The Problem</h3>
<p>Achieving a high First Pass Yield is crucial for manufacturing efficiency and product quality. However, manufacturers often face challenges that impact FPY:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>Process Variabilities:</strong> Inconsistencies in manufacturing processes can lead to defects and lower yield rates.</li>
<li><strong>Quality Control Issues:</strong> Inadequate quality control measures can result in a high rate of rework or scrap.</li>
<li><strong>Equipment Performance:</strong> Suboptimal performance of machinery and equipment can adversely affect product quality.</li>
<li><strong>Material Quality:</strong> Variability in raw material quality can lead to inconsistent product outputs.</li>
<li><strong>Data Integration and Analysis:</strong> Difficulty in integrating and analyzing data from various stages of the manufacturing process to identify root causes of yield issues.</li>
</ol>
