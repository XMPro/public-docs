this example demonstrates how to use the

union agent to combine temperature data

from pumps a b and c

first drag the agent onto the canvas

linking the input endpoints to each

pump's data

and the output to the printer

save the data stream

and click on the agent to see the

configuration blade

there is nothing to do here so publish

the data stream and let's look at the

live data view

the received events are combined but

pump b's flow rate and pump c's

vibration are excluded as they are not

common to all incoming payloads

you can download the file below to try

it out yourself and for more information

about this agent's properties head to

the configuration page

thank you
